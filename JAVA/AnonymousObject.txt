}
// BTS: In JVM, we have Stack as well as Heap memory.
// object is created in Heap memory. obj(reference variable) is in stack memory refering to object location in Heap
// object in Heap contains the method show()
// NOTE: A obj = new A();   here new A() is the object creation and obj is reference variable to that object

// new A()  is called ANONYMOUS OBJECT i.e. objects with no reference
// problem with these is we can't reuse them
// new A().show();
