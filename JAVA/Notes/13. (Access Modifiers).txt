-> Access Modifiers in Java (PRIVATE,PUBLIC,PROTECTED)
Specifier where a property/method is accessible.

(i)Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class. We use getters,setters for it.
Used for data hiding.
private String name;
print int age;

(ii)Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package 
and outside the package.

(iii)Protected: The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.
The protected access modifier can be applied on the data member, method and constructor. It can't be applied on the class.
It provides more accessibility than the default modifer.

(iv) Default:
Dont have to write anything.
If you don't use any modifier, it is treated as default by default. The default modifier is accessible only within package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package.
 It provides more accessibility than private. But, it is more restrictive than protected, and public.
