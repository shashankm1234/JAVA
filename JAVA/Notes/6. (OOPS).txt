-> OOPS (Object Oriented Programming)
DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)
// Solving a problem by creating objects is Object Oriented Programming(mainly to solve real-world problems).
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
(i) OOP is faster and easier to execute
(ii) OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
(iii) OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
(iv) OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Class-> Employee
Attributes(data members) -> name,age,salary
Methods(member functions) -> getSalary(),increment()

-> CUSTOM CLASS (NOTE: In a Java file, there can be only 1 public class.)
class Employee{
     int id=12;
     String name="Harry";
     // method of class
     public void printDetails(){ 
         System.put.print("My name is " + name + " and my id is " + id);
}
}
public static void main(String[]args){
     Employee harry = new Employee();       // created an object named harry of class Employee
     // harry.id = 12;
     // harry.name = "Harry";
     sout(harry.id);       //12
     sout(harry.name);     //Harry
}


Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
Eg. class(Fruit) , objects(Apple,Banana,Mango)
class(Car) , objects(Volvo,Audi,Toyota)

To create a class, use the keyword class:
Create a class named "Main" ,file name is Main.java.
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}

Creating an Object:
public class Classes {
    // class must be named on file name
    // here x variable is inside class Classes, in main() object myObj is made
    // then using dot(.) , obj accesses x
    int x = 5;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Classes myObj = new Classes();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

MULTIPLE OBJECTS
public class Classes {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Classes myObj1 = new Classes();  // Object 1
    Classes myObj2 = new Classes();  // Object 2
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);
  }
}

-> Using MULTIPLE CLASSES
You can also create an object of a class and access it in another class. This is often used for better organization of classes (one class has all the attributes 
and methods, while the other class holds the main() method (code to be executed)).
Remember that the name of the java file should match the class name. In this example, we have created two files in the same directory/folder:
Main.java
Second.java

In Main.java:
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}

In Second.java:
class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Now when both files have been compiled, run Second.java file
O.P. 5

-> Class ATTRIBUTES(also called FIELDS)
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
  int y = 3;
}
Here x,y are attributes of class Main.

Accessing Attributes
You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.)
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Modifying attributes:
myObj.x = 40;
System.out.println(myObj.x);         // 40

If you don't want the ability to override existing values, declare the attribute as final:
public class Main {
  final int x = 10;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    myObj.x = 25; // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

-> STATIC vs. PUBLIC
You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.
In the example above, we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed 
without creating an object of the class, unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects.

-> Access Methods With an Object
Create a Car object named myCar. Call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program:

// Create a Main class
public class Main {
  // Create a fullThrottle() method
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }
  // Create a speed() method and add a parameter
  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
  }
  // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();   // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
  }
}

-> Java Modifiers
The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
(1) Access Modifiers - controls the access level

For CLASSES
(i) public : The class is accessible by any other class
(ii) default : The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. 

For ATTRIBUTES,METHODS and CONSTRUCTORS
(i) public : The code is accessible for all classes
(ii) private : The code is only accessible within the declared class
(iii) default : The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. 
(iv) protected : The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. 

(2) Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality

For CLASSES
(i) final : class cannot be inherited by other classes 
(ii) abstract : The class cannot be used to create objects,to access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class.

For ATTRIBUTES and METHODS
final,static,absract
