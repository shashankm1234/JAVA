->Java was developed in 1991(James Goslin). JAVA is completely object-oriented.

Q.How Java works?
Ans.Java source code gets compiled in byte code of java, then gets interpreted in machine code.
Java is compiled & interpreted language.

-> JDK(Java Development Kit) is a collection of tools used for developing & running java programs.
-> JRE(Java Runtime Environment) helps in executing programs developed in Java.

-> Basic structure of Java program
pachage com.company;       // groups classes & functions
public class Main{
   public static void main(String[] args){
       System.out.println("Hello world");          // Prints Hello world (sout for shortcut)
}}
// File name saved as should be same as class name i.e. Main.java
// main() is auto function in java , each thing inside it gets executed , program starts from main() function, compulsory for java program
// static makes it possible for us to run function of class without making its object.

-> Naming Concentions
For classes: PascalCase i.e. MainClass
For functions: camelCase i.e. myFunction

-> package com.company is a parent package used in java to group classes,usually for companies.

-> import used to use classes of different files in our file code.

-> USER INPUT: Scanner
Java has a Scanner class.Scanner class has a lot of methods to read data from keyboard.
Importing it: import java.util.Scanner;   (now in our code we can use Scanner class)
Scanner sc = new Scanner;
Code: import java.util.Scanner;
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);     // System.in means we want to read from keyboard 
      System.out.print("Enter number: ");
      int a = sc.nextInt();
      System.out.println("Number is : " + a);
      float b = sc.nextFloat();

-> hasNextInt()  checks for type of input entered correct or not 
boolean b = sc.hasNextInt();
sout(b);          // if user enters integer when b has true but if user enters float or any other type, b has false
// user for checking validation of user input
// hasNextFloat()
// For string
String str = sc.next();
sout(str);     // reads word and stops reading after a space
Eg. harry is a good boy
O.P. harry

-> sc.nextLine() To read full line 
String str = sc.nextLine();
sout(str);  
Eg. harry is a good boy
O.P. harry is a good boy
